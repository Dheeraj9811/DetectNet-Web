echo "# DetectNet-Web\n\nDetectNet-Web is a simple object detection application that utilizes TensorFlow.js and the COCO-SSD model to detect objects in real time using your webcam. It can detect multiple objects simultaneously and draw bounding boxes around them.\n\n## Features\n\n- Real-time object detection using webcam feed\n- Uses TensorFlow.js and COCO-SSD model\n- Detects multiple objects at once\n- Draws bounding boxes around detected objects\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo get started with DetectNet-Web, follow these steps:\n\n1. Clone the repository:\n\n   \`\`\`bash\n   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DetectNet-Web.git\n   \`\`\`\n\n2. Install dependencies:\n\n   \`\`\`bash\n   cd DetectNet-Web\n   npm install\n   \`\`\`\n\n3. Run the application:\n\n   \`\`\`bash\n   npm start\n   \`\`\`\n\n4. Open your web browser and navigate to \`http://localhost:3000\` to use the application.\n\n## Usage\n\n- Upon launching the application, you will be prompted to select a webcam device.\n- Once a webcam is selected, the application will start detecting objects in real time from the webcam feed.\n- Detected objects will be highlighted with bounding boxes.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!
